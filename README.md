# Standard Notes Overcast Theme

Overcast, to become cloudy or dark — just like this Standard Notes theme.
This theme is based off Standard Notes' official [Midnight Theme](https://github.com/sn-extensions/midnight-theme) and the color scheme was inspired by the [Monokai Pro](https://monokai.pro/) Visual Studio Code theme.

## Installation

1. Open the [Standard Notes web app](https://app.standardnotes.org/).

2. In extensions, click import, paste `https://changelog.ceiphr.com/p/wMLniolIii` and hit `ENTER`.

3. Click "Install," then activate the *Overcast* theme.
